I am currently a software engineer in the industry an alumus of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Guwahati. 
My topics of interest include backend technologies, blockchain and cloud technologies. My most use tech stack is `node.js`.

On a side note I am conflicted between being a cat or dog person, I sure like em both (okay maybe cats a little bit more).
